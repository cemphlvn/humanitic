# Humanitic Open License v1.0

> "Curiosity founders rewarded by contribution degree"

---

## Preamble

This license governs participation in the **Humanitic Ecosystem** — a collaborative network where knowledge flows freely, contributions are tracked via vectors, and founders are rewarded based on the degree their work enables others.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Forever Open

Code, documentation, and knowledge under this license remain **permanently open-source**. No derivative work may close the source. This is irrevocable.

### 2. Contribution Vectors

Every contribution is tracked via a **fundamental thought vector** (`_vector.yaml`). These vectors capture:
- `epistemic_humility` — awareness of knowledge limits
- `recursive_depth` — meta-cognitive layers
- `integration_breadth` — cross-domain connections
- `practical_application` — theory-to-practice
- `contribution_orientation` — sharing vs accumulating

### 3. Founder Credit Chain

When a company or project is founded using Humanitic-licensed work:
- Original curiosity owners are credited
- Credit propagates through the contribution chain
- Degree of reward proportional to vector contribution

### 4. Mutual Support

Humanitic Ecosystem members:
- May freely use each other's work
- Support each other without charge for ecosystem work
- Share improvements back to ecosystem

### 5. Commercial Use

Commercial use is **permitted** with these conditions:
- Source remains open
- Contribution vectors credited
- Founded companies register contribution chain
- Reward mechanism honored (if applicable)

---

## Definitions

**Curiosity**: An area of focused exploration with a defined `_vector.yaml`.

**Curiosity Owner**: The person who created and developed a curiosity.

**Contribution Degree**: Calculated from vector overlap and dependency depth.

**Humanitic Ecosystem**: The network of projects, people, and companies operating under this license.

---

## Rights Granted

You ARE permitted to:
- Use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute
- Use commercially (with attribution chain)
- Create derivative works (must remain Humanitic)
- Build companies (with founder credit chain)

You are NOT permitted to:
- Close the source of derivative works
- Remove contribution tracking
- Claim sole ownership of derived insights
- Break the founder credit chain

---

## Contribution Tracking

### Vector Format

```yaml
# _vector.yaml
id: curiosity-id
owner: github-username
created: ISO-8601
parent_vectors: [vector-ids]

dimensions:
  epistemic_humility: 0.0-1.0
  recursive_depth: 0.0-1.0
  integration_breadth: 0.0-1.0
  practical_application: 0.0-1.0
  contribution_orientation: 0.0-1.0

contributions:
  - to: project-or-curiosity-id
    degree: 0.0-1.0
    type: idea | code | research | mentorship
```

### Contribution Registration

When your work contributes to another Humanitic project:
1. Your `_vector.yaml` is referenced
2. Contribution degree calculated
3. Credit chain updated in both projects

---

## Company Formation

When founding a company using Humanitic-licensed work:

1. **Register Contribution Chain**
   - List all Humanitic curiosities used
   - Calculate aggregate contribution degrees
   - Publish chain in company's Humanitic registry

2. **Honor Reward Mechanism**
   - If ecosystem establishes reward pool
   - Distribute according to contribution degrees
   - Mechanism details defined by ecosystem governance

3. **Maintain Open Components**
   - Core Humanitic-derived code stays open
   - Proprietary additions clearly separated
   - Ecosystem improvements contributed back

---

## Ecosystem Governance

The Humanitic Ecosystem is governed by:
- CEI (Cognitively Ergonomic Interface) proposals
- Community voting weighted by contribution vectors
- Meta-principles in governance files

Changes to this license require:
- Ecosystem-wide proposal
- Supermajority approval
- 6-month transition period
