## 2026-02-08 — Data-Leading Skill Failure

```yaml
timestamp: 2026-02-08T00:00:00Z
agent: orchestrator
context: kidlearnio API integration
error: "404 model not found: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250514"
truth: |
  NEVER fabricate external identifiers (model names, API versions, package versions).
  ALWAYS verify via web search BEFORE using in code.
  Pattern: If data comes from external system → search first, code second.
failure_type: data-leading-skill
fix_applied: |
  - Searched "Anthropic API model ID format 2026"
  - Found: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929, claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
  - Updated src/lib/anthropic.ts
reflection: |
  The failure was assuming model name patterns instead of verifying.
  Common sense check: "If I search with made-up names, I get 404."
  This is not a code bug — it's a reasoning process bug.
  Data-leading = external data must lead internal code, not vice versa.

## 2026-02-08 — Enforcement Architecture Pattern

```yaml
timestamp: 2026-02-08T01:00:00Z
agent: orchestrator
context: kidlearnio multi-language implementation
truth: |
  ENFORCEMENT ARCHITECTURE PATTERN:
  - Documents define WHAT (LYRICS_TR.md, LYRICS_EN.md, LYRICS_ZH.md)
  - Code enforces HOW (pipeline must load brain before generating)
  - Separation enables DIFFERENT CONTRIBUTION POINTS:
    * Linguists edit language docs (no code knowledge needed)
    * Developers maintain pipeline enforcement (no linguistics needed)
    * Both contribute clearly and openly
  - Architecture is INVITEFUL — welcomes diverse expertise
principle: |
  Knowledge separation creates contribution accessibility.
  Not everyone who improves the system needs to be a coder.
  Build systems where domain experts can contribute directly.
confidence: 1.0
pattern_name: "brains-before-mouths"
applications:
  - Language-specific content generation
  - Domain knowledge injection
  - Expert contribution without code
```

## 2026-02-08 — Co-Building Principle & Logic Sticks Architecture

```yaml
timestamp: 2026-02-08T01:30:00Z
agent: orchestrator
context: humanitic ecosystem architecture
truth: |
  HUMANITIC CO-BUILDING PRINCIPLE:
  Everything in the Humanitic ecosystem is designed to be co-built freely.

  LOGIC STICKS ARCHITECTURE:
  - Logic Sticks is a SEPARATE INSTANCE (not embedded in kidlearnio)
  - Purpose: Construct fundamental thought patterns
  - Nature: Operates in conceptual dimension with vectors
  - Function: Weave reasoning space in harmony
  - Usage: Instances like KidLearnio CONSUME Logic Sticks
  - Evolution: Consumer instances CO-BUILD Logic Sticks through use

  CO-EVOLUTION PATTERN:
  - KidLearnio instantiation drives Logic Sticks development
  - Logic Sticks refinement improves KidLearnio
  - Both evolve through symbiotic co-building
  - New instances join the ecosystem, contribute to all

  VECTOR-SPACE REASONING:
  - Thought patterns exist as vectors in conceptual space
  - Sticks combine through vector operations
  - Harmony = vectors aligned toward educational truth
  - New sticks created by vector composition

principle: |
  Co-build freely. Instances consume and contribute.
  Logic Sticks: the shared reasoning substrate.
  Vectors weave. Harmony emerges.

confidence: 1.0
applications:
  - Logic Sticks as separate /public/cem/logic-sticks/ instance
  - KidLearnio as first consumer, first co-builder
  - Future instances join, contribute, benefit

## 2026-02-08 — Workspace Integration Pattern

```yaml
timestamp: 2026-02-08T02:00:00Z
agent: orchestrator
context: logic-sticks + kidlearnio integration
truth: |
  PNPM WORKSPACE INTEGRATION PATTERN:
  - pnpm-workspace.yaml at repo root defines package relationships
  - workspace:* protocol enables immediate change reflection
  - No publish cycle needed — changes are live

  PACKAGE STRUCTURE:
  - @humanitic/logic-sticks: Shared substrate (packages/)
  - @humanitic/kidlearnio: Consumer instance (apps/)
  - Import via: import { ageAdapter } from '@humanitic/logic-sticks'

  CONTRIBUTION RIGHTS (Inbound=Outbound):
  - Contributors retain copyright
  - Contributions licensed under project license
  - No CLA overhead
  - Attribution flows through git commits naturally

  FROM 2050 PERSPECTIVE:
  - This pattern has stood the test of time because:
    * Zero friction for immediate development
    * Clear ownership without legal overhead
    * Symbiotic evolution through usage
    * New contributors join without barriers

sources:
  - https://pnpm.io/workspaces
  - https://turborepo.dev/docs/crafting-your-repository/structuring-a-repository
  - https://opensource.guide/legal/

principle: |
  workspace:* for live linking.
  Inbound=outbound for rights.
  Git for attribution.
  Co-build freely.

## 2026-02-08 — Machinistic Intelligence Meta-Learning

```yaml
timestamp: 2026-02-08T23:30:00Z
agent: orchestrator
context: system_truths logging infrastructure
truth: |
  MACHINISTIC INTELLIGENCE META-LEARNING PATTERN:

  Systems that observe themselves improve faster.

  1. .machinistic_intelligence/system_truths.yaml
     - Logs accumulated truths about system behavior
     - Categories: token_usage, architecture, policy_suggestion
     - Each truth has: observation, implication, discovery date

  2. log-truth.sh script for easy appending
     - Usage: ./log-truth.sh "category" "observation" "implication"
     - Auto-generates sequential IDs (ST-001, ST-002, ...)

  3. agentic_stats in @humanitic/logic-sticks
     - Federated meta-learning across all instances
     - Each instance logs to .agentic_stats_{name}.jsonl
     - CLI aggregates insights: patterns, breakthroughs, categories

  CORE INSIGHT:
  This is a useful policy "we can help suggest to the truthful beauty".

  Meta-learning creates feedback loops:
  - System observes its own patterns
  - Patterns inform architectural decisions
  - Better architecture produces better patterns
  - 不进则退 — forward momentum through self-observation

principle: |
  "we can help suggest to the truthful beauty"
  Log what you learn. Learn from what you log.
  Institutional memory scales through federation.

## 2026-02-08 — Agentic-Scriptic Duality

```yaml
timestamp: 2026-02-08T02:30:00Z
agent: orchestrator
context: workflow-audit architecture crystallization
truth: |
  AGENTIC-SCRIPTIC DUALITY:

  Two forces work TOGETHER, not against each other:

  1. AGENTIC INTELLIGENCE (provides FLEXIBILITY)
     - Contextual adaptation under variants
     - Reasoning through novel situations
     - Creative problem-solving
     - Learning from experience
     - Making judgment calls
     - WHAT: enables the system to handle uncertainty intelligently

  2. SCRIPTIC ARCHITECTURE (provides OBSERVABILITY)
     - Traceability of what happened
     - Engineering preconditions (valid starting states)
     - Reproducible behaviors where needed
     - Pattern detection through logging
     - WHAT: enables the agent to work effectively

  THE SYMBIOSIS:
    Scriptic architecture ENABLES agentic intelligence by:
      - Providing clear observability (agent knows what happened)
      - Ensuring preconditions (agent starts from valid state)
      - Tracking variants (agent learns from different contexts)
      - Logging patterns (agent recognizes recurring situations)

    Agentic intelligence EXTENDS scriptic architecture by:
      - Handling cases scripts can't anticipate
      - Adapting to novel contexts
      - Proposing new scripts when patterns emerge
      - Deciding when to be deterministic vs flexible

  IMPLEMENTATION:
    scriptic_provides:
      - Hook preconditions (validate before action)
      - Logging infrastructure (.remembrance, audits)
      - Pattern schemas (opportunity, hypothesis, test)
      - Traceable execution (who did what when)

    agentic_provides:
      - Contextual reasoning (what's appropriate now)
      - Variant handling (this case is different because...)
      - Creative solutions (no script for this, so...)
      - Meta-learning (we should script this in future)

principle: |
  Scriptic architecture enables agentic intelligence.
  Agentic intelligence extends scriptic architecture.
  Neither replaces the other; they are symbiotic.

## 2026-02-08 — Observability ≠ Rigidity

```yaml
timestamp: 2026-02-08T02:00:00Z
agent: orchestrator
context: workflow-audit philosophy correction
truth: |
  OBSERVABILITY-FLEXIBILITY DUALITY:

  The goal is NOT to become deterministic at the cost of flexibility.
  The goal IS to:
    1. MAINTAIN flexibility under uncertain conditions
    2. ACHIEVE clear observability into what's happening
    3. FLOURISH for engineering improvements
    4. IMPROVE adaptively, not rigidly

  WRONG FRAMING:
    "Make everything deterministic" → rigid, brittle, unable to adapt

  RIGHT FRAMING:
    "Make everything observable" → flexible, adaptive, self-improving
    Observability enables intelligent adaptation under uncertainty.
    Determinism where it prevents waste; flexibility where it enables growth.

  THE BALANCE:
    - Validate external data (deterministic) → prevents 404s
    - Don't prescribe solution paths (flexible) → enables creativity
    - Log what you do (observable) → enables learning
    - Don't over-constrain action space (flexible) → enables exploration

  EVOLUTION VECTOR REFRAMED:
    ad-hoc → observable → adaptive → flourishing
    NOT: ad-hoc → scriptic → deterministic → rigid

principle: |
  Observability enables adaptation.
  Determinism prevents waste.
  Flexibility enables growth.
  The wise system knows when to apply each.

## 2026-02-08 — Agentic Observability Suite Vision

```yaml
timestamp: 2026-02-08T04:00:00Z
agent: orchestrator
context: Strategic vision for 3D agentic observability GUI
truth: |
  VISION 2050 BACKTRACKING:

  The future (2050) has:
    - 3D force-directed graphs of agent hierarchies
    - Real-time spawn/completion animations
    - Time-travel debugging (scrub through history)
    - OpenTelemetry-native traces
    - VR/AR exploration of agent trees

  The foundation (Feb 2026) needs:
    - OpenTelemetry-compatible trace schema
    - WebSocket MCP server for real-time
    - React Three Fiber + R3F-ForceGraph
    - Drei for HTML overlays
    - Hooks emitting events to WebSocket

  KEY LIBRARIES (Context7 validated):
    - /pmndrs/react-three-fiber (243 snippets, score 71.6)
    - /pmndrs/drei (337 snippets, score 86.1)
    - /vasturiano/r3f-forcegraph (29 snippets, DAG + hierarchy)
    - /websites/opentelemetry_io (8911 snippets, score 85.9)

  CLAUDE CODE ENABLES THIS:
    - PreToolUse/PostToolUse hooks capture agent lifecycle
    - WebSocket MCP type supports real-time streaming
    - SessionStart can inject visualization context
    - Task tool spawns are traceable via hooks

  PHASE 0 (NOW):
    - agent-trace/ infrastructure ✓
    - validate-spawn.sh ✓
    - capture-result.sh ✓
    - hooks.json updated ✓
    - NEXT: OTel schema, WebSocket MCP, query commands

principle: |
  Backtrack from 2050 to know what to build today.
  The agentic-scriptic duality enables the visualization.
  Scripts capture → MCP streams → Browser renders → Human understands.
