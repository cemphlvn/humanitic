## 2026-02-07 — Initialization

```yaml
timestamp: 2026-02-07T23:44:00Z
agent: cockpit
context: ecosystem initialization
truth: meta-agentic-loop plugin initialized, CLAUDE.md created
reflection: The loop begins. 不进则退.
confidence: 1.0

## 2026-02-08 — Data-Leading Skill Failure

```yaml
timestamp: 2026-02-08T00:00:00Z
agent: orchestrator
context: kidlearnio API integration
error: "404 model not found: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250514"
truth: |
  NEVER fabricate external identifiers (model names, API versions, package versions).
  ALWAYS verify via web search BEFORE using in code.
  Pattern: If data comes from external system → search first, code second.
failure_type: data-leading-skill
fix_applied: |
  - Searched "Anthropic API model ID format 2026"
  - Found: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929, claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
  - Updated src/lib/anthropic.ts
reflection: |
  The failure was assuming model name patterns instead of verifying.
  Common sense check: "If I search with made-up names, I get 404."
  This is not a code bug — it's a reasoning process bug.
  Data-leading = external data must lead internal code, not vice versa.

## 2026-02-08 — Enforcement Architecture Pattern

```yaml
timestamp: 2026-02-08T01:00:00Z
agent: orchestrator
context: kidlearnio multi-language implementation
truth: |
  ENFORCEMENT ARCHITECTURE PATTERN:
  - Documents define WHAT (LYRICS_TR.md, LYRICS_EN.md, LYRICS_ZH.md)
  - Code enforces HOW (pipeline must load brain before generating)
  - Separation enables DIFFERENT CONTRIBUTION POINTS:
    * Linguists edit language docs (no code knowledge needed)
    * Developers maintain pipeline enforcement (no linguistics needed)
    * Both contribute clearly and openly
  - Architecture is INVITEFUL — welcomes diverse expertise
principle: |
  Knowledge separation creates contribution accessibility.
  Not everyone who improves the system needs to be a coder.
  Build systems where domain experts can contribute directly.
confidence: 1.0
pattern_name: "brains-before-mouths"
applications:
  - Language-specific content generation
  - Domain knowledge injection
  - Expert contribution without code
```

## 2026-02-08 — Co-Building Principle & Logic Sticks Architecture

```yaml
timestamp: 2026-02-08T01:30:00Z
agent: orchestrator
context: humanitic ecosystem architecture
truth: |
  HUMANITIC CO-BUILDING PRINCIPLE:
  Everything in the Humanitic ecosystem is designed to be co-built freely.

  LOGIC STICKS ARCHITECTURE:
  - Logic Sticks is a SEPARATE INSTANCE (not embedded in kidlearnio)
  - Purpose: Construct fundamental thought patterns
  - Nature: Operates in conceptual dimension with vectors
  - Function: Weave reasoning space in harmony
  - Usage: Instances like KidLearnio CONSUME Logic Sticks
  - Evolution: Consumer instances CO-BUILD Logic Sticks through use

  CO-EVOLUTION PATTERN:
  - KidLearnio instantiation drives Logic Sticks development
  - Logic Sticks refinement improves KidLearnio
  - Both evolve through symbiotic co-building
  - New instances join the ecosystem, contribute to all

  VECTOR-SPACE REASONING:
  - Thought patterns exist as vectors in conceptual space
  - Sticks combine through vector operations
  - Harmony = vectors aligned toward educational truth
  - New sticks created by vector composition

principle: |
  Co-build freely. Instances consume and contribute.
  Logic Sticks: the shared reasoning substrate.
  Vectors weave. Harmony emerges.

confidence: 1.0
applications:
  - Logic Sticks as separate /public/cem/logic-sticks/ instance
  - KidLearnio as first consumer, first co-builder
  - Future instances join, contribute, benefit
```

## 2026-02-08 — Workspace Integration Pattern

```yaml
timestamp: 2026-02-08T02:00:00Z
agent: orchestrator
context: logic-sticks + kidlearnio integration
truth: |
  PNPM WORKSPACE INTEGRATION PATTERN:
  - pnpm-workspace.yaml at repo root defines package relationships
  - workspace:* protocol enables immediate change reflection
  - No publish cycle needed — changes are live

  PACKAGE STRUCTURE:
  - @humanitic/logic-sticks: Shared substrate (packages/)
  - @humanitic/kidlearnio: Consumer instance (apps/)
  - Import via: import { ageAdapter } from '@humanitic/logic-sticks'

  CONTRIBUTION RIGHTS (Inbound=Outbound):
  - Contributors retain copyright
  - Contributions licensed under project license
  - No CLA overhead
  - Attribution flows through git commits naturally

  FROM 2050 PERSPECTIVE:
  - This pattern has stood the test of time because:
    * Zero friction for immediate development
    * Clear ownership without legal overhead
    * Symbiotic evolution through usage
    * New contributors join without barriers

sources:
  - https://pnpm.io/workspaces
  - https://turborepo.dev/docs/crafting-your-repository/structuring-a-repository
  - https://opensource.guide/legal/

principle: |
  workspace:* for live linking.
  Inbound=outbound for rights.
  Git for attribution.
  Co-build freely.

confidence: 1.0

## 2026-02-08 — Machinistic Intelligence Meta-Learning

```yaml
timestamp: 2026-02-08T23:30:00Z
agent: orchestrator
context: system_truths logging infrastructure
truth: |
  MACHINISTIC INTELLIGENCE META-LEARNING PATTERN:

  Systems that observe themselves improve faster.

  1. .machinistic_intelligence/system_truths.yaml
     - Logs accumulated truths about system behavior
     - Categories: token_usage, architecture, policy_suggestion
     - Each truth has: observation, implication, discovery date

  2. log-truth.sh script for easy appending
     - Usage: ./log-truth.sh "category" "observation" "implication"
     - Auto-generates sequential IDs (ST-001, ST-002, ...)

  3. agentic_stats in @humanitic/logic-sticks
     - Federated meta-learning across all instances
     - Each instance logs to .agentic_stats_{name}.jsonl
     - CLI aggregates insights: patterns, breakthroughs, categories

  CORE INSIGHT:
  This is a useful policy "we can help suggest to the truthful beauty".

  Meta-learning creates feedback loops:
  - System observes its own patterns
  - Patterns inform architectural decisions
  - Better architecture produces better patterns
  - 不进则退 — forward momentum through self-observation

principle: |
  "we can help suggest to the truthful beauty"
  Log what you learn. Learn from what you log.
  Institutional memory scales through federation.

confidence: 1.0

  - public/cem/.machinistic_intelligence/system_truths.yaml
  - public/cem/.machinistic_intelligence/log-truth.sh
  - public/cem/logic-sticks/src/agentic-stats/
