## 2026-02-08 — Data-Leading Skill Failure

```yaml
timestamp: 2026-02-08T00:00:00Z
agent: orchestrator
context: kidlearnio API integration
error: "404 model not found: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250514"
truth: |
  NEVER fabricate external identifiers (model names, API versions, package versions).
  ALWAYS verify via web search BEFORE using in code.
  Pattern: If data comes from external system → search first, code second.
failure_type: data-leading-skill
fix_applied: |
  - Searched "Anthropic API model ID format 2026"
  - Found: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929, claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
  - Updated src/lib/anthropic.ts
reflection: |
  The failure was assuming model name patterns instead of verifying.
  Common sense check: "If I search with made-up names, I get 404."
  This is not a code bug — it's a reasoning process bug.
  Data-leading = external data must lead internal code, not vice versa.
