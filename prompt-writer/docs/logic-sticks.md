# Logic Sticks

> Logical scaffolding patterns that the CSA uses to structure educational content. A "logic stick" is a structural spine that holds the song together — the invisible skeleton that makes the learning stick.

## What Is a Logic Stick?

A logic stick is a **logical progression pattern** embedded in the song structure. It's not the content — it's the SHAPE of the argument. Children don't need to know it's there. They just feel that the song "makes sense."

---

## Stick 1: THE LADDER

**Pattern:** A → B → C → D (each step builds on the previous)
**Best for:** Sequential processes, cause-and-effect chains

```
Verse 1: Step A (foundation)
Verse 2: Step B (builds on A)
Chorus:  The whole ladder summarized
Verse 3: Step C (builds on B)
Bridge:  Step D (the peak / conclusion)
```

**Example — Water Cycle:**
- A: Sun heats water (evaporation)
- B: Water rises, forms clouds (condensation)
- C: Clouds get heavy (precipitation)
- D: Water flows back (collection)
- Chorus: "Round and round the water goes!"

---

## Stick 2: THE MIRROR

**Pattern:** A ↔ B (two things compared/contrasted side by side)
**Best for:** Compare/contrast, opposites, dualities

```
Verse 1: Thing A described
Verse 2: Thing B described (same structure, different content)
Chorus:  What they share / how they connect
Bridge:  The surprising similarity or difference
```

**Example — Plant Cell vs Animal Cell:**
- A: Plant cell has walls, chloroplasts, big vacuole
- B: Animal cell has membrane, mitochondria, small vacuoles
- Chorus: "Both alive, both have a nucleus inside!"
- Bridge: "But only one can make its food from light"

---

## Stick 3: THE ZOOM

**Pattern:** Macro → Micro → Macro (zoom in, then zoom back out)
**Best for:** Scale concepts, systems thinking, anatomy

```
Verse 1: The big picture (what you see)
Verse 2: Zoom in (what's inside)
Verse 3: Zoom in further (the smallest unit)
Chorus:  The connection between scales
Bridge:  Zoom all the way back out — now you see it differently
```

**Example — The Human Body:**
- Big: Your body moves and breathes
- Medium: Organs working together
- Small: Cells dividing, DNA copying
- Chorus: "Billions of tiny parts, one beating heart"

---

## Stick 4: THE ANCHOR

**Pattern:** Known → Unknown → Known+ (start familiar, go strange, return enriched)
**Best for:** Abstract concepts, introducing new vocabulary

```
Verse 1: Something the child already knows well
Verse 2: The new concept, linked to the familiar
Chorus:  The new concept IN TERMS of the familiar
Bridge:  Now the familiar is richer because of the new
```

**Example — Gravity:**
- Known: "You jump, you come back down"
- Unknown: "There's a force pulling everything together"
- Known+: "That same pull holds the moon in the sky"
- Chorus: "Gravity's the hug the Earth gives everything"

---

## Stick 5: THE RHYTHM LOCK

**Pattern:** Pattern → Repetition → Variation → Lock
**Best for:** Memorization content, times tables, spelling rules

```
Verse 1: Pattern introduced with strong rhythm
Chorus:  Pattern repeated exactly (lock it in)
Verse 2: Pattern with slight variation (extends understanding)
Chorus:  Same pattern (reinforcement)
Bridge:  Break the pattern — then bring it back stronger
Final Chorus: Pattern is now automatic
```

**Example — 7 Times Table:**
- Pattern: "7, 14, 21, 28" (rhythmic chant over beat)
- Variation: "35, 42, 49, 56" (same rhythm, new numbers)
- Break: "What's 7 times 8?" (pause) "56!" (drop)
- Lock: Full sequence sung at speed

---

## Stick 6: THE WEB

**Pattern:** Center → Spoke 1 → Spoke 2 → Spoke 3 → Center+
**Best for:** Topics with multiple related aspects, ecosystems, social systems

```
Verse 1: The central concept
Verse 2: First connection/aspect
Verse 3: Second connection/aspect
Bridge:  Third connection — the surprising one
Chorus:  Everything connects back to center
```

**Example — Photosynthesis:**
- Center: Plants make their own food
- Spoke 1: Sunlight → energy
- Spoke 2: CO2 → carbon
- Spoke 3: Water → hydrogen
- Chorus: "Sun + water + air = sugar + the oxygen we share"

## Logic Stick Selection Matrix

| Subject Type | Primary Stick | Secondary Stick |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Sequential process | LADDER | RHYTHM LOCK |
| Compare/contrast | MIRROR | ANCHOR |
| Scale/systems | ZOOM | WEB |
| New vocabulary | ANCHOR | MIRROR |
| Memorization | RHYTHM LOCK | LADDER |
| Interconnected topics | WEB | ZOOM |

## Composition Rules

1. **Every song uses exactly ONE primary logic stick** — mixing sticks creates confusion
2. **The chorus ALWAYS reflects the logic stick's core pattern** — it's the stick's strongest expression
3. **The bridge is where the stick BENDS** — surprise, twist, or deepening
4. **Verses follow the stick's progression** — never jump ahead or back
5. **The outro returns to the stick's origin** — closure through return

---

## CSA Responsibility

The CSA selects the logic stick BEFORE the Lyrics Agent begins writing. The selection is based on:
- Subject domain analysis
- Age-appropriate complexity
- Learning approach (memorization vs connection)
- Session memory (what sticks have worked for this topic domain before)

The CSA communicates the selected stick to the Lyrics Agent as part of its strategy approval.
