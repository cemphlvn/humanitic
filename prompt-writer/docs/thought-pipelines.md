# Thought Pipelines

> These are the cognitive flow sequences that agents follow. The CSA reads this document before every generation to select the appropriate pipeline.

---

## Pipeline 1: WONDER → QUESTION → DISCOVERY

**Best for:** Science, nature, physical world concepts
**Age groups:** K-6, 7-12

### Flow:
1. **WONDER** — Open with something astonishing. A fact that makes you go "wait, WHAT?"
2. **QUESTION** — Turn that wonder into a question the child would naturally ask
3. **DISCOVERY** — The answer unfolds through the song, each verse revealing a layer
4. **OWNERSHIP** — The chorus is the child's own declaration of understanding

### Lyrics Structure Mapping:
```
[Intro]        → WONDER moment (instrumental + hook)
[Verse 1]      → The astonishing fact / observation
[Pre-Chorus]   → The natural question that arises
[Chorus]       → The DISCOVERY — the "aha!" moment sung proudly
[Verse 2]      → Deeper layer / second wonder
[Bridge]       → Connection to something the child already knows
[Final Chorus] → OWNERSHIP — "I understand this now"
[Outro]        → Callback to the original wonder
```

## Pipeline 2: PATTERN → RHYTHM → RECALL

**Best for:** Mathematics, sequences, formulas, vocabulary
**Age groups:** K-6, 7-12

### Flow:
1. **PATTERN** — Establish a rhythmic pattern that mirrors the mathematical/logical pattern
2. **RHYTHM** — Lock the pattern into a beat that the brain can't unhear
3. **RECALL** — The pattern becomes automatic through melodic repetition
4. **EXTEND** — Apply the pattern to new examples in later verses

### Lyrics Structure Mapping:
```
[Intro]        → Rhythmic hook that IS the pattern
[Verse 1]      → First examples set to the pattern
[Chorus]       → The rule/formula as a singable hook
[Verse 2]      → More examples, increasing complexity
[Chorus]       → Repetition locks it in
[Bridge]       → "Now YOU try" — interactive moment
[Final Chorus] → Full confidence recall
```

## Pipeline 3: STORY → CHARACTER → LESSON

**Best for:** History, social studies, ethics, literature
**Age groups:** 7-12, 13-18

### Flow:
1. **STORY** — A character faces a real situation from history/literature
2. **CHARACTER** — The child identifies with the character's emotions
3. **LESSON** — The lesson emerges from the story naturally
4. **REFLECTION** — The bridge connects past to present

### Lyrics Structure Mapping:
```
[Intro]        → Setting the scene
[Verse 1]      → Character introduction + situation
[Verse 2]      → The challenge / conflict / question
[Chorus]       → The core lesson as an emotional declaration
[Verse 3]      → Resolution / what happened
[Bridge]       → "What would YOU do?" — personal connection
[Final Chorus] → The lesson resonates personally
[Outro]        → Echo of the opening, transformed
```

## Pipeline 4: CONNECT → LAYER → INTEGRATE

**Best for:** Complex systems, biology, chemistry, physics
**Age groups:** 13-18, 18-24
**Method:** 6-Layer Andragogy Approach

### Flow:
1. **CONNECT** — Link to something the student already knows
2. **LAYER 1** — Surface structure (what you can see/touch)
3. **LAYER 2** — Mechanism (how it works)
4. **LAYER 3** — Why it works that way (principles)
5. **LAYER 4** — Connections to other systems
6. **INTEGRATE** — The whole picture, unified

### Lyrics Structure Mapping:
```
[Intro]        → The familiar connection
[Verse 1]      → Layer 1 — observable facts
[Verse 2]      → Layer 2 — the mechanism
[Pre-Chorus]   → Layer 3 — the principle
[Chorus]       → The unified understanding
[Verse 3]      → Layer 4 — cross-connections
[Bridge]       → Layer 5+6 — synthesis + implications
[Final Chorus] → INTEGRATION — everything clicks
[Outro]        → Return to the familiar, now transformed
```

## Pipeline 5: PLAY → EXPLORE → BUILD

**Best for:** Creative subjects, language arts, music theory
**Age groups:** K-6

### Flow:
1. **PLAY** — Start with pure play, no rules
2. **EXPLORE** — Discover patterns within the play
3. **BUILD** — Use those patterns to create something
4. **SHARE** — The chorus is something to sing WITH others

### Lyrics Structure Mapping:
```
[Intro]        → Playful sounds / nonsense that becomes sense
[Verse 1]      → Playing with the concept
[Chorus]       → The pattern discovered, celebrated
[Verse 2]      → Building with the pattern
[Bridge]       → Surprise twist / unexpected connection
[Final Chorus] → Singing together — shared knowledge
```

## Pipeline Selection Rules

The CSA selects a pipeline based on:

| Factor | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Subject domain | 30% |
| Age group | 25% |
| Learning approach (memorization vs connection) | 25% |
| Session history (what worked before) | 20% |

### Override Rules:
- If age ≤ 6: ALWAYS prefer Pipeline 1 or 5
- If subject is math: ALWAYS consider Pipeline 2
- If learning approach is "6-Layer": USE Pipeline 4
- If learning approach is "Memorization": USE Pipeline 2
- CSA may COMBINE pipelines (e.g., Pipeline 1 opening + Pipeline 2 chorus)
