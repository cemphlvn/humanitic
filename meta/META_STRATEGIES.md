## What Are Meta-Strategies?

Not tactics for solving problems, but:
- When to switch strategies entirely
- How to recognize strategy failure
- Which meta-patterns govern strategy selection
- How strategies evolve through use

## The Strategy Stack

## Core Meta-Strategies

### 1. The Probe Strategy

**When**: Uncertain territory, unclear problem shape

```yaml
probe:
  action: Small, reversible experiments
  observe: What happens, what's revealed
  adapt: Based on feedback, not prediction

  nuance: |
    Probing is not random. Each probe tests a hypothesis.
    But hold hypotheses loosely.
```

**Anti-pattern**: Big moves in fog

### 2. The Scaffold Strategy

**When**: Building something complex

```yaml
scaffold:
  action: Build temporary structure
  purpose: Support construction, not be the building
  remove: When no longer needed

  nuance: |
    Scaffolds that stay become technical debt.
    But removing too early causes collapse.
    Timing is the skill.
```

**Anti-pattern**: Permanent scaffolding, premature removal

### 3. The Inversion Strategy

**When**: Stuck in forward motion

```yaml
inversion:
  action: Work backwards from desired state
  ask: "What would make this impossible?"
  avoid: Those things

  nuance: |
    Inversion reveals constraints invisible from start.
    But don't get lost in negative space.
    Return to positive construction.
```

**Anti-pattern**: Endless problem prevention without creation

### 4. The Oscillation Strategy

**When**: Need both depth and breadth

```yaml
oscillation:
  action: Alternate between zoom-in and zoom-out
  depth: Dive into details
  breadth: Surface for context

  nuance: |
    Neither pure depth nor pure breadth suffices.
    The rhythm matters. Find your oscillation frequency.
    Context determines optimal cycle length.
```

**Anti-pattern**: Stuck at one level

### 5. The Surrender Strategy

**When**: Forcing isn't working

```yaml
surrender:
  action: Stop pushing, let the problem work on you
  wait: For insight to emerge
  trust: The unconscious processing

  nuance: |
    Surrender is not giving up.
    It's releasing grip to find better grip.
    Requires having done the work first.
    You can't surrender what you haven't engaged.
```

**Anti-pattern**: Passive avoidance disguised as patience

### 6. The Ensemble Strategy

**When**: Complex problem with multiple valid approaches

```yaml
ensemble:
  action: Apply multiple strategies in parallel
  combine: Insights from each
  arbitrate: Where they conflict

  nuance: |
    Ensemble is not hedging.
    Each approach contributes unique signal.
    Conflicts are information, not problems.
```

**Anti-pattern**: Decision paralysis from too many options

## Strategy Selection Meta-Patterns

### Pattern: Match to Phase

| Phase | Preferred Strategy |
|-------|-------------------|
| Exploration | Probe |
| Construction | Scaffold |
| Stuck | Inversion, Surrender |
| Integration | Ensemble |
| Refinement | Oscillation |

### Pattern: Match to Certainty

```
High Certainty → Direct execution
Medium Certainty → Scaffold + Probe
Low Certainty → Probe first
Zero Certainty → Surrender, then Probe
```

### Pattern: Match to Energy

```
High Energy → Construction strategies
Low Energy → Observation strategies
Frustrated Energy → Inversion, Surrender
Flow Energy → Don't strategize, continue
```

## When Strategies Fail

Signs that strategy isn't working:

```yaml
failure_signals:
  - repeated_same_action: Different contexts, same move
  - diminishing_returns: More effort, less progress
  - growing_frustration: Emotional signal of mismatch
  - lost_orientation: Can't explain what you're doing
  - tunnel_vision: Only seeing one path
```

### The Strategy Switch Protocol

```
1. NOTICE: Something isn't working
2. NAME: Which strategy am I using?
3. DIAGNOSE: Why isn't it fitting?
4. SCAN: What other strategies could apply?
5. SELECT: Choose based on diagnosis
6. COMMIT: Give new strategy fair trial
7. EVALUATE: After sufficient attempt
```

**Nuance**: Don't switch too fast (strategy hopping) or too slow (stubborn persistence). The skill is timing.

## Strategy Evolution

Strategies aren't fixed. They evolve:

```yaml
evolution_triggers:
  - repeated_success: Strategy strengthens
  - repeated_failure: Strategy questioned
  - novel_situation: Strategy tested in new context
  - cross_pollination: Strategies from others absorbed
  - reflection: Conscious refinement

evolution_log:
  location: _vector.yaml
  track: strategy_weights, context_matches
```

---

## Ecosystem Strategy Sharing

In Humanitic ecosystem:

```yaml
strategy_flow:
  share:
    - What worked in which contexts
    - How strategies evolved
    - Failure patterns and pivots

  receive:
    - Others' strategy innovations
    - Cross-domain applications
    - Warning signals

  credit:
    - Strategy originators
    - Evolution contributors
    - Context adapters
```

---

## The Meta-Strategy Paradox

The more you strategize about strategies:
- The more options you see
- The harder selection becomes
- The more you're tempted to meta-meta-strategize

**Resolution**: Strategy serves action. When meta-strategy doesn't improve strategy selection, stop and act.

```yaml
escape_hatch:
  when: Meta-strategic thinking loops
  action: Pick any reasonable strategy
  trust: You'll adapt as you learn
  remember: Action generates information
```

---

## Integration with Role

Your curiosity shapes your strategy preferences:

```yaml
curiosity_strategy_link:
  high_epistemic_humility: Favors Probe, Surrender
  high_recursive_depth: Comfortable with meta-levels
  high_integration_breadth: Favors Ensemble
  high_practical_application: Favors direct strategies
  high_contribution_orientation: Considers ecosystem impact
```

Your role emerges from your strategy patterns.
Your strategies evolve to serve your role.
