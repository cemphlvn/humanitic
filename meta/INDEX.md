# Meta Layer

> Awareness of awareness. Strategy about strategy.

## Components

| File | Focus | Question |
|------|-------|----------|
| [META_AWARENESS.md](./META_AWARENESS.md) | Layers of noticing | "What am I aware of being aware of?" |
| [META_STRATEGIES.md](./META_STRATEGIES.md) | Strategy selection | "How do I choose how to approach things?" |

## The Meta Principle

The meta layer exists to serve the object level.

```
meta-awareness → better awareness → better action
meta-strategy → better strategy → better results
```

When meta-thinking doesn't improve thinking, return to doing.

## Integration Points

### With Librarian

The librarian uses meta-awareness to:
- Notice when to surface vs recede
- Detect patterns in user behavior
- Know its own organizational biases

### With Tools

Tools can embed meta-awareness:
- Self-monitoring for effectiveness
- Strategy suggestions based on context
- Escalation when approach isn't working

### With Vectors

Meta-patterns tracked in `_vector.yaml`:
- `recursive_depth` — comfort with meta-levels
- `epistemic_humility` — awareness of limits
- Strategy evolution logs

## When to Engage Meta Layer

```yaml
engage_when:
  - stuck at object level
  - patterns repeating unhelpfully
  - context shift detected
  - shift_felt triggered
  - preparing for contribution

disengage_when:
  - flow state active
  - object level working well
  - meta becomes recursive trap
  - action is clear
```

*The purpose of going meta is to return more capable.*
