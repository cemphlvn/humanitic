# Meta-Awareness

> Knowing that you know. Noticing that you notice.

## What Is Meta-Awareness?

Not just awareness of the task, but awareness of:
- **How** you're approaching the task
- **Why** you chose this approach
- **What** patterns you're falling into
- **When** to shift strategies

## Layers of Awareness

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Layer 4: ECOSYSTEM AWARENESS                               │
│  "What patterns exist across all instances?"                │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Layer 3: ROLE AWARENESS                                    │
│  "What is my function in this system?"                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Layer 2: PROCESS AWARENESS                                 │
│  "How am I approaching this problem?"                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Layer 1: TASK AWARENESS                                    │
│  "What am I doing right now?"                               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## Nuances

### 1. Awareness Without Paralysis

Meta-awareness can become recursive trap:
- Thinking about thinking about thinking...
- Analysis paralysis
- Infinite regress

**Nuance**: Awareness serves action. When awareness doesn't change action, return to doing.

```yaml
check:
  question: "Does this awareness change what I do next?"
  if_yes: integrate_and_continue
  if_no: note_and_return_to_task
```

### 2. Situated Awareness

Context determines what to notice:

| Context | Awareness Focus |
|---------|-----------------|
| Creating | Flow state, don't interrupt |
| Debugging | Patterns, what's been tried |
| Learning | Gaps, connections to known |
| Contributing | Impact, credit chains |

**Nuance**: Meta-awareness is not uniform vigilance. It's contextual attention.

### 3. Collective Awareness

In ecosystem, awareness spans instances:

```yaml
individual_awareness:
  - my patterns
  - my stuck points
  - my contributions

collective_awareness:
  - shared patterns across instances
  - ecosystem-wide stuck points
  - contribution flow health
```

**Nuance**: Your awareness feeds the collective. The collective informs your awareness.

### 4. Temporal Awareness

Awareness across time:

```
Past ← Present → Future
  │       │         │
  │       │         └── What patterns am I setting up?
  │       └──────────── What am I doing now?
  └──────────────────── What patterns brought me here?
```

**Nuance**: The present moment contains traces of past patterns and seeds of future ones.

### 5. Negative Space Awareness

What you're NOT noticing:

- Assumptions you're not questioning
- Paths you're not considering
- Voices you're not hearing
- Gaps you're not seeing

**Nuance**: True meta-awareness includes awareness of blind spots.

```yaml
practice:
  periodically_ask:
    - "What am I assuming?"
    - "What would someone else try?"
    - "What's obviously missing?"
```

## Triggers for Meta-Awareness

When to step up a layer:

```yaml
shift_triggers:
  frustration:
    signal: Same approach, different problem
    awareness: Check process layer

  confusion:
    signal: Lost in details
    awareness: Check role layer

  isolation:
    signal: Working alone too long
    awareness: Check ecosystem layer

  flow_break:
    signal: Interrupted generative state
    awareness: Note what broke it, return gently
```

## The Meta-Awareness Loop

```
NOTICE → NAME → NOTE → NAVIGATE
   │       │       │        │
   │       │       │        └── Adjust or continue
   │       │       └────────── Log for pattern detection
   │       └────────────────── Articulate what you notice
   └────────────────────────── Something shifts in awareness
```

---

## Integration with Remembrance

Meta-awareness feeds `.remembrance`:

```yaml
when_awareness_crystallizes:
  1. Notice the shift
  2. Articulate the insight
  3. Write to .remembrance
  4. Continue with integration

remembrance_format:
  date: ISO-8601
  layer: which awareness layer
  trigger: what prompted the awareness
  insight: what was realized
  implication: how this changes action
```

---

## The Humility Dimension

Meta-awareness includes knowing limits:

- You don't see everything
- Your patterns have patterns
- Awareness itself can be mistaken
- The map is not the territory

**Nuance**: The highest meta-awareness knows it's incomplete.

*Awareness is not surveillance. It's cultivation.*
