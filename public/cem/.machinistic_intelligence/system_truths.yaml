truths:

  - id: ST-001
    discovered: 2026-02-08
    category: token_usage
    observation: |
      Multi-orchestrator architecture with curiosity_spark + CuriosityCoordinator
      adds ~500 tokens to prompt but produces significantly better structured output.
    implication: Pre-computed stick guidance trades tokens for quality.

  - id: ST-002
    discovered: 2026-02-08
    category: architecture
    observation: |
      Coordinators (like CuriosityCoordinator) should run AFTER context gathering
      but BEFORE generation. They need gathered facts to coordinate effectively.
    implication: Pipeline order matters. Sticks → Context → Coordinators → Generation.

    observation: |
      Logging system truths as meta-learning is useful for:
      1. Tracking what works across sessions
      2. Building institutional memory for the codebase
      3. Informing future architectural decisions
    implication: This is a useful policy we can help suggest to the user.

    discovered: 2026-02-08
    category: token_usage
    observation: |
      Generation with full stick pipeline (6 sticks + 1 coordinator) produced 28-line song in ~50s
    implication: Token investment in pre-computation pays off in output quality
