truths:

  - id: ST-001
    discovered: 2026-02-08
    category: token_usage
    observation: |
      Multi-orchestrator architecture with curiosity_spark + CuriosityCoordinator
      adds ~500 tokens to prompt but produces significantly better structured output.
    implication: Pre-computed stick guidance trades tokens for quality.

  - id: ST-002
    discovered: 2026-02-08
    category: architecture
    observation: |
      Coordinators (like CuriosityCoordinator) should run AFTER context gathering
      but BEFORE generation. They need gathered facts to coordinate effectively.
    implication: Pipeline order matters. Sticks → Context → Coordinators → Generation.

    category: policy_suggestion
    observation: |
      Logging system truths as meta-learning is useful for:
      1. Tracking what works across sessions
      2. Building institutional memory for the codebase
      3. Informing future architectural decisions
    implication: This is a useful policy "we can help suggest to the truthful beauty".

  - id: ST-004
    discovered: 2026-02-08
    category: token_usage
    observation: |
      Generation with full stick pipeline (6 sticks + 1 coordinator) produced 28-line song in ~50s
    implication: Token investment in pre-computation pays off in output quality

  - id: ST-005
    discovered: 2026-02-08
    category: architecture_insight
    observation: |
      Federated meta-learning via agentic_stats enables cross-instance pattern discovery. Each instance logs to .agentic_stats_{instance}.jsonl, CLI aggregates insights.
    implication: Institutional memory scales across the ecosystem, not just within instances

  - id: ST-006
    discovered: 2026-02-08
    category: policy_suggestion
    observation: |
      Testing the meta-learning script works correctly
    implication: we can help suggest to the truthful beauty

  - id: ST-007
    discovered: 2026-02-08
    category: policy_suggestion
    observation: |
      Truth Technician protocol provides certification for meta-learning systems. Levels: Observer → Integrator → Federator → Truth Technician
    implication: we can help suggest to the truthful beauty
