## Cognitive Semantics

### How English Thinks

```yaml
english_mind_model:

  agent_focus:
    degree: high
    pattern: |
      English strongly foregrounds the DOER (agent)
      "The sun heats the water" (active preferred)
      Not: "The water is heated by the sun" (passive)
      For kids: Active voice = clearer understanding

  evidentiality:
    active: false
    note: |
      English doesn't grammatically mark information source
      Use hedges instead: "Scientists say...", "We know that..."
      For facts: State directly, no hedging needed

  spatial_framing:
    type: relative
    pattern: |
      "Left/right/front/back" relative to speaker/object
      Good for: body-based learning ("your left hand")

  time_perception:
    pattern: |
      Linear, segmented time
      Past-Present-Future clearly separated
      Tense consistency important in songs
```

### Cultural Mental Models

```yaml
cultural_patterns:

  individual_achievement:
    usage: |
      "You can do it!"
      "Be the best you can be"
      Individual empowerment in chorus

  discovery_narrative:
    usage: |
      "Let's find out..."
      "Discover the secret..."
      Journey/adventure metaphor strong

  fairness_and_rules:
    usage: |
      "That's the rule"
      "Fair and square"
      Rules as organizing principle

  nature_as_resource:
    usage: |
      Nature described functionally
      "The sun gives us energy"
      "Plants make our food"
```

## Grammatical Features

### Word Order

```yaml
basic_structure: SVO (Subject-Verb-Object)

song_flexibility:
  normal: "The water evaporates"
  inverted: "Up goes the water!" (poetic)
  fronted: "Evaporation—that's the magic word"

rule: |
  Verb in middle = natural flow
  Sentence-final stress on last content word
  "The water goes UP" (stress on UP)

rhyme_position: |
  End of line = rhyme position
  Usually noun or verb
  "sun/fun", "grow/know", "see/be"
```

### Question Formation

```yaml
question_types:
  yes_no: "Do you know...?"
  wh_question: "What makes...? Why does...?"
  tag_question: "It's amazing, isn't it?"

educational_use:
  engagement: "Can you guess what happens next?"
  participation: "Are you ready? (Yeah!)"
  wonder: "Have you ever wondered why...?"

song_placement: |
  Questions before chorus = engagement
  "Do you know how plants grow?
   Let me show, here we go!"
```

---

## Morphological Features

### Word Formation

```yaml
english_morphology:
  type: mostly analytic (not agglutinative)
  pattern: |
    Meaning through word order, not endings
    Few inflections: -s, -ed, -ing, -er, -est

song_impact:
  challenge: |
    Less rhyme from inflections
    Need to find rhyming words carefully

  advantage: |
    Short words = quick rhythm
    Compound words = creative ("sunshine", "rainbow")
    Easy to make up words for songs
```

### Contractions

```yaml
contractions:
  common: "it's, don't, can't, won't, we're, you're"

song_usage:
  rhythm_helper: |
    "It is" (2 syllables) → "It's" (1 syllable)
    Contractions smooth the flow

  example: |
    "Don't you know the water flows
     It's going up and down it goes"
```

---

## Phonetic Features

### Syllable Structure

```yaml
english_syllable:
  structure: Complex (CCCVCCCC possible)
  common: CVC, CV, CVCC

song_rhythm:
  stressed_timing: |
    English is STRESS-TIMED
    Stressed syllables at regular intervals
    "The WA-ter E-va-po-RATES"

  beats_not_syllables: |
    Count beats, not syllables
    4-beat lines most common:
    "The SUN shines DOWN (beat) WARM"
```

### Stress Patterns

```yaml
word_stress:
  pattern: Variable (not fixed)
  rules: Complex, many exceptions

compound_stress:
  rule: First element stressed
  example: "SUNshine", "RAINbow", "WATerfall"

song_stress:
  match_melody: |
    Melodic stress = word stress
    "EvaPOration" needs stress on "PO"
    Mismatch = awkward singing

  common_pattern: |
    Trochaic: STRONG-weak (WA-ter, SUN-shine)
    Iambic: weak-STRONG (a-BOUT, be-CAUSE)
```

### Sound Devices

```yaml
alliteration:
  examples:
    - "Silly sun shining so strong"
    - "Water wanders, wind blows west"
  usage: Hook lines, memorable phrases

assonance:
  examples:
    - "The rain in Spain stays mainly..."
    - "Go slow, don't you know"
  usage: Internal melody, flow

consonance:
  examples:
    - "Tick tock, rock clock"
    - "Stuff enough, rough tough"
  usage: End sounds, subtle rhyme
```

## Example Song Structure

### Memorization Song — Planets

```
[Hook]
Can you name them? Yes you can!
Solar system, here's the plan:

[Verse 1]
Mercury's first, closest to the sun,
Venus comes next, we've just begun,
Earth is third—that's our home,
Mars is fourth, red as a gnome!

[Chorus]
Eight planets going round and round,
In our solar system, look what we found!
Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars,
Jupiter, Saturn, shooting stars!
Uranus, Neptune, cold and blue,
Now you know them—good for you!

[Verse 2]
Jupiter's biggest, king of them all,
Saturn's got rings, standing tall,
Uranus spins sideways—weird but true,
Neptune's the farthest, icy blue!

[Bridge - Proverb hook]
Practice makes perfect, so they say,
Name those planets every day!
```

### Connection Song — Water Cycle

```
[Anchor - Familiar Ground]
When you take a bath and the mirror fogs,
When puddles dry up and you see no frogs,
Have you ever wondered where water goes?
Let me tell you secrets that nobody knows...

[Chorus - Core Concept]
Evaporation—water goes up! (whoosh!)
Condensation—clouds fill the cup! (poof!)
Precipitation—falling back down! (splash!)
The water cycle goes round and round!

[Bridge - Known to Unknown]
It's just like your breath on a winter day,
The warmth meets the cold in a misty way,
That's condensation, that's the key,
And clouds in the sky? Same thing, you see!

[Expansion]
The sun is the engine, heating the sea,
Water vapor rises, floating free,
High up where it's cold, clouds start to form,
And when they get heavy—here comes the storm!

[Application - Real World]
Next time it rains, you can say with pride:
"I know where you've been on your water ride!
Maybe the ocean, maybe a lake,
The same water's been here since dinosaurs ate!"

[Final Chorus]
Evaporation, condensation,
Precipitation—what a sensation!
The water cycle, round and round,
The same drops of water, forever found!
```
