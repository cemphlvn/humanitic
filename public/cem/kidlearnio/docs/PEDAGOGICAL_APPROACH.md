# Pedagogical Approach — Agent Knowledge Document

> **Two modes: MEMORIZATION and CONNECTION**
> Based on Knowles' Andragogy adapted for children + Active Learning research

---

## Core Framework

```yaml
philosophy: Children are natural learners — not empty vessels
approach: Meet them where they are, take them where they need to go
modes:
  memorization: Quick encoding of discrete facts (mnemonics, abbreviations, rhythm)
  connection: Deep understanding through relation-building (6-layer approach)
```

---

## Mode 1: MEMORIZATION Technique

### Purpose
Encode discrete facts that need quick recall:
- Spelling rules
- Math facts (times tables)
- Scientific terms
- Historical dates
- Vocabulary

### Techniques

#### 1. Acronym/Abbreviation Songs

```yaml
pattern: First letters of items form memorable word
example:
  topic: Order of planets
  acronym: "My Very Eager Mother Just Served Us Nachos"
  lyrics: |
    M is for Mercury, closest to the sun
    V for Venus, spinning's never done
    E for Earth, that's our home sweet home
    M for Mars, the red planet roams...

song_structure:
  - Each verse handles one letter
  - Chorus repeats the full acronym
  - Simple, repetitive melody
```

#### 2. Number Rhyme Encoding

```yaml
pattern: Numbers paired with rhyming images
example:
  topic: Times tables
  approach: |
    "3 times 4 is at the door (12)
     Knock knock knock, who's there? Twelve more!"

song_structure:
  - Verse per equation
  - Visual rhyme creates memory hook
  - Chorus cycles through key facts
```

#### 3. Rhythm Chunking

```yaml
pattern: Group information into rhythmic units
example:
  topic: Periodic table elements
  approach: |
    "H-He-Li-Be (clap clap)
     B-C-N-O (clap clap)
     F-Ne-Na-Mg (clap clap)
     Now you know the first twelve, yeah!"

song_structure:
  - 4-beat chunks
  - Physical action (clapping) reinforces
  - Repetition in chorus
```

#### 4. Story Hook

```yaml
pattern: Embed fact in mini-narrative
example:
  topic: Spelling "because"
  approach: |
    "Big Elephants Can Always Understand Small Elephants
     B-E-C-A-U-S-E, that's how you spell it, can't you see?"

song_structure:
  - Narrative verse
  - Spelling chorus
  - Repeat 3x for encoding
```

## Mode 2: CONNECTION Technique (6-Layer Approach)

### Purpose
Build deep understanding of concepts that require comprehension:
- How things work (systems)
- Why things happen (causation)
- Relationships between concepts
- Abstract principles

### The 6 Layers

```yaml
layer_1_anchor:
  name: "Familiar Ground"
  purpose: Start from what child already knows
  song_placement: Opening verse
  example: "You know how water feels when you take a bath..."

layer_2_bridge:
  name: "Connection Bridge"
  purpose: Link known to unknown
  song_placement: Second verse
  example: "...that same water travels up into the sky!"

layer_3_core:
  name: "Core Concept"
  purpose: Introduce the key learning
  song_placement: Chorus
  example: "Evaporation, evaporation / Water goes up to the cloud station!"

layer_4_expansion:
  name: "Expanding Understanding"
  purpose: Add nuance and detail
  song_placement: Third verse
  example: "Heat from the sun makes the water dance / Rising up in an invisible trance"

layer_5_application:
  name: "Real World Use"
  purpose: Connect to child's life
  song_placement: Bridge
  example: "That's why puddles disappear / After the rain, the sun is here!"

layer_6_synthesis:
  name: "Bringing It Together"
  purpose: Complete the understanding circle
  song_placement: Final chorus + outro
  example: "From bath to sky to clouds to rain / The water cycle starts again!"
```

### Song Structure for 6-Layer

```
[Opening - Layer 1: Anchor]
Something child knows well
Sets emotional/cognitive ground

[Verse 1 - Layer 2: Bridge]
"Did you know that..."
Connection from known to unknown

[Chorus - Layer 3: Core]
The main concept
Memorable, repeatable
Key vocabulary embedded

[Verse 2 - Layer 4: Expansion]
Deeper explanation
How/why it works
More detail for older kids

[Bridge - Layer 5: Application]
"Next time you see..."
Real world connection
Child's daily life

[Final Chorus - Layer 6: Synthesis]
Repeat core concept
Add completion phrase
"Now you know!"
```

## Knowles' 6 Principles (Adapted for Children)

Original andragogy adapted to spark intrinsic motivation in kids:

```yaml
principle_1_need_to_know:
  adult: "Adults need to know why they need to learn"
  child_adaptation: "Make the learning relevant to their world"
  song_technique: Open with a relatable scenario

principle_2_experience:
  adult: "Adults build on their experience"
  child_adaptation: "Connect to their existing knowledge (toys, games, family)"
  song_technique: Use familiar metaphors (playground, animals, food)

principle_3_self_concept:
  adult: "Adults need to feel responsible for learning"
  child_adaptation: "Give them agency through prediction and discovery"
  song_technique: Include interactive moments ("Can you guess?")

principle_4_readiness:
  adult: "Adults are ready when it solves immediate problems"
  child_adaptation: "Connect to current interests and questions"
  song_technique: Address real kid questions ("Why is the sky blue?")

principle_5_orientation:
  adult: "Adults want problem-focused learning"
  child_adaptation: "Frame as solving a mystery or puzzle"
  song_technique: Use mystery/discovery narrative

principle_6_motivation:
  adult: "Internal motivation drives adults"
  child_adaptation: "Tap into natural curiosity and play instinct"
  song_technique: Make it fun first, educational second
```

## Age-Specific Adjustments

```yaml
ages_5_7:
  vocabulary: Simple, concrete words
  sentence_length: 5-7 words
  concepts: Single-step relationships
  metaphors: Animals, toys, family
  technique_bias: 70% memorization, 30% connection

ages_8_10:
  vocabulary: Introduce some technical terms (with bridges)
  sentence_length: 7-10 words
  concepts: Multi-step relationships OK
  metaphors: Sports, games, nature, technology
  technique_bias: 50% memorization, 50% connection

ages_11_14:
  vocabulary: Technical terms with context
  sentence_length: 10+ words OK
  concepts: Abstract relationships possible
  metaphors: Social dynamics, current culture, systems
  technique_bias: 30% memorization, 70% connection
```

## Output Integration

### For Lyrics Agent

```yaml
memorization_song:
  - Use techniques 1-4 from Mode 1
  - Keep chorus very simple and repetitive
  - Physical action suggestions (clap, snap, stomp)
  - Maximum 2 minutes
  - Repeat key facts 4+ times

connection_song:
  - Follow 6-layer structure
  - Build progressively
  - Chorus is the core concept
  - Can be 2-3 minutes
  - Key concept repeated 3 times minimum
```

### For Style Agent

```yaml
memorization_style:
  genre: Children's pop, nursery rhyme, playground chant
  tempo: 100-120 BPM (easy to follow)
  vocals: Clear enunciation, child-friendly range

connection_style:
  genre: Educational pop, story-song, folk-inspired
  tempo: 90-110 BPM (allows for storytelling)
