# Curiosity Techniques — Agent Knowledge Document

> **"The secret is curiosity-sparking, not information-dumping"**
> Based on Curiosity in Classrooms (CiC) framework and active learning research

## Core Principle

```yaml
truth: Curiosity is sparked by UNCERTAINTY GAPS
mechanism: Gap between what child knows and wants to know
optimization: Right-sized gaps — not too small (boring), not too large (frustrating)
```

## The Two Curiosity Engines

### Engine 1: INITIATE (Spark)

Make children recognize and become comfortable with uncertainty.

```yaml
techniques:
  wonder_prompt:
    pattern: "I wonder what would happen if..."
    example: "I wonder what would happen if all the water disappeared?"
    effect: Opens mental space for exploration

  novelty_injection:
    pattern: Introduce unexpected element
    example: "Did you know your bones are wetter than the ocean?"
    effect: Surprise creates attention spike

  mystery_box:
    pattern: Present incomplete information
    example: "There's a number that you can never divide by. What could it be?"
    effect: Gap creates pull toward resolution

  impossible_question:
    pattern: Ask something that seems impossible
    example: "How do you weigh air?"
    effect: Cognitive tension demands resolution
```

### Engine 2: EXPLORE (Sustain)

Help children learn to seek information to resolve curiosity.

```yaml
techniques:
  breadcrumb_trail:
    pattern: Reveal information in stages
    example: "First the water goes up... (how?)... then it becomes a cloud... (why?)"
    effect: Each answer reveals new question

  connection_bridge:
    pattern: Link unknown to known
    example: "Remember how you feel when you spin? The Earth feels that too."
    effect: Familiar becomes gateway to unfamiliar

  prediction_game:
    pattern: Invite guessing before revealing
    example: "What do you think will happen? ... Let's find out!"
    effect: Investment in outcome increases engagement

  expert_role:
    pattern: Child becomes the explainer
    example: "Now you teach your teddy bear why the sky is blue"
    effect: Teaching solidifies and tests understanding
```

## Technique Selection Matrix

| Age Range | Primary Technique | Why |
|-----------|-------------------|-----|
| 5-7 | Wonder Prompt + Novelty | Short attention, need immediate hook |
| 8-10 | Mystery Box + Prediction | Can hold uncertainty longer |
| 11-14 | Impossible Question + Connection | Abstract thinking emerging |

## Lyrics Application

### MEMORIZATION Songs (Technique: Engine 1 → Immediate Spark)

```yaml
structure:
  hook: Start with wonder prompt or novelty
  verse: Present the mystery
  chorus: The memorable fact/answer
  bridge: Playful reinforcement

example_pattern:
  hook: "I wonder why the sun goes down..."
  verse: "Every day it rises high / Traveling across the sky"
  chorus: "Round and round the Earth we spin / That's why day ends and nights begin!"
  bridge: "Spinning, spinning, never stopping / Day to night, the world keeps rocking"
```

### CONNECTION Songs (Technique: Engine 2 → Deep Exploration)

```yaml
structure:
  opening: Connection bridge to something known
  journey: Breadcrumb trail through concepts
  chorus: Core connection/insight
  bridge: Prediction or expert role
  closing: Return to origin with new understanding

example_pattern:
  opening: "Your heart beats like a drum inside..."
  journey: "Pumping red through tubes so wide / To fingers, toes, and back again"
  chorus: "Blood is like a river flowing / Bringing food to keep you growing!"
  bridge: "Can you feel it? Put your hand right here / Boom boom boom, it's always near"
  closing: "Every beat, a gift from you / Your body's drum plays strong and true"
```

## Style Prompt Integration

When generating Suno style prompts, match style to curiosity engine:

```yaml
engine_1_memorization:
  style_keywords:
    - catchy
    - repetitive
    - bouncy
    - sing-along
    - simple melody
  avoid:
    - complex
    - experimental
    - ambient

engine_2_connection:
  style_keywords:
    - building
    - layered
    - exploratory
    - dynamic
    - evolving
  avoid:
    - monotonous
    - single-note
    - static
```

---

## Anti-Patterns (What Kills Curiosity)

```yaml
avoid:
  - Starting with "Today we will learn about..."
  - Listing facts without context
  - Answering before questioning
  - Using jargon without bridges
  - Making it feel like homework
  - Rushing the uncertainty phase
  - Providing complete answers too early
```
