## PURPOSE

Logic Sticks is the **shared reasoning substrate** of the Humanitic ecosystem.

```yaml
what_it_is:
  - Reusable atomic reasoning patterns
  - Thought vectors in conceptual space
  - Compositional building blocks for agent reasoning

what_it_is_not:
  - A library (it's a living substrate)
  - Static documentation (it evolves through use)
  - Instance-specific (it's shared across all consumers)
```

---

## CO-BUILDING MODEL

```yaml
consumers:
  kidlearnio:
    uses:
      - age_adapter
      - curiosity_spark
      - memorability_booster
      - structure_scaffold
      - language_router
    contributes:
      - Educational domain refinements
      - Language-specific patterns
      - Pedagogical insights

future_consumers:
  - Add your instance here
  - Consume sticks
  - Contribute improvements

evolution:
  - Usage reveals missing sticks
  - Consumer feedback refines existing sticks
  - New sticks emerge from composition
  - Harmony increases over time
```

## CORE STICKS

See `/docs/STICK_CATALOG.md` for the full catalog.

### Foundational Sticks

| Stick | Purpose | Consumers |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| `age_adapter` | Adjust content for target age | kidlearnio |
| `curiosity_spark` | Transform statements into curiosity triggers | kidlearnio |
| `memorability_booster` | Enhance phrase memorability | kidlearnio |
| `connection_bridge` | Bridge known to unknown concepts | kidlearnio |
| `structure_scaffold` | Apply consistent structure patterns | kidlearnio |
| `vocabulary_gate` | Check and replace vocabulary | kidlearnio |
| `language_router` | Route through language-specific brain | kidlearnio |

---

## VECTOR SPACE MODEL

```yaml
conceptual_dimension:
  space: Reasoning vectors
  operations:
    - composition: Combine sticks into complex patterns
    - alignment: Ensure sticks work in harmony
    - projection: Apply stick to specific domain

harmony:
  definition: Vectors aligned toward truth
  measurement: Consumer success, feedback loops
  optimization: Continuous through co-building
```

## CONTRIBUTING A STICK

```yaml
template:
  name: unique_identifier
  purpose: single_sentence_description
  vector: conceptual_direction
  logic: |
    GIVEN inputs
    PROCESS with clear steps
    RETURN outputs
  composition: which_sticks_it_composes_with
  consumers: who_uses_this
```
