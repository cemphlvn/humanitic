## Purpose

Curiosity is the engine of learning. Before teaching WHAT, we must spark WHY.

This document defines patterns that transform facts into questions, statements into mysteries.

## Core Curiosity Triggers

### 1. Mystery Box
Turn a fact into a puzzle to solve.

| Instead of | Say |
|------------|-----|
| "Water evaporates when heated" | "Where does the puddle disappear to?" |
| "Plants make their own food" | "What if I told you plants are secret chefs?" |
| "The moon causes tides" | "Why does the ocean chase the moon?" |

### 2. Surprise Reveal
Lead with the unexpected.

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| "Did you know..." | "Did you know you're drinking dinosaur water?" |
| "What if..." | "What if the sky isn't really blue?" |
| "Guess what..." | "Guess what — you're made of star stuff!" |

### 3. Personal Connection
Make it about THEM.

| Abstract | Personal |
|----------|----------|
| "Blood carries oxygen" | "Right now, your heart is pumping..." |
| "Earth rotates" | "You're spinning at 1,000 mph right now!" |
| "Sound is vibration" | "Your voice is making the air shake!" |

### 4. Contradiction Hook
Present a seeming impossibility.

| Hook | Resolution |
|------|------------|
| "Heavy ships float, but tiny pebbles sink" | → Density/displacement |
| "Ice is solid water, but it floats" | → Molecular structure |
| "The sun doesn't move, but we see it rise" | → Earth's rotation |

### 5. Scale Shock
Use extreme numbers or comparisons.

| Boring | Shocking |
|--------|----------|
| "The sun is big" | "One million Earths fit inside the sun" |
| "Bacteria are small" | "More bacteria on your hand than people on Earth" |
| "Light is fast" | "Light circles Earth 7.5 times per second" |

## Curiosity Killers (Avoid)

| Killer | Why it fails |
|--------|--------------|
| "Today we'll learn about X" | No mystery, no hook |
| "X is important because..." | Tells instead of shows |
| "Memorize these facts" | Removes agency |
| "This is complicated but..." | Creates fear |

## Curiosity Sustainers

After sparking curiosity, sustain it:

1. **Breadcrumbs** — Reveal partial answers that lead to new questions
2. **Callbacks** — Reference earlier mysteries ("Remember when we asked...")
3. **Cliffhangers** — End sections with new questions
4. **Ownership** — "Now YOU know the secret!"

## Contributor Examples

**If you're a teacher:** Add triggers that worked in your classroom.

**If you're a parent:** Add questions your kids asked that sparked learning.

**If you're a science communicator:** Add hooks from successful explanations.

**If you're a child psychologist:** Add developmentally appropriate patterns.
