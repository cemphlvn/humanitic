# Vector Space Model for Logic Sticks

> **"Thought patterns as vectors in conceptual dimension"**

---

## Conceptual Foundation

```yaml
premise: |
  Reasoning patterns exist in a conceptual vector space.
  Each stick is a direction in this space.
  Composition = vector operations.
  Harmony = aligned vectors producing coherent output.

space_properties:
  dimensions: Conceptual (not geometric)
  operations: [composition, alignment, projection]
  measurement: Consumer success, reasoning coherence
```

## Vector Properties of Sticks

### Direction Types

```yaml
vector_categories:

  engagement:
    sticks: [curiosity_spark]
    direction: Toward wonder, attention, participation

  accessibility:
    sticks: [age_adapter, vocabulary_gate]
    direction: Toward comprehension for target audience

  retention:
    sticks: [memorability_booster, rhyme_finder]
    direction: Toward long-term memory encoding

  scaffolding:
    sticks: [connection_bridge, structure_scaffold]
    direction: Toward building understanding progressively

  localization:
    sticks: [language_router]
    direction: Toward native cognitive patterns
```

## Composition Operations

### Sequential Composition

```yaml
operation: chain
description: Apply sticks in sequence, output flows to next
example:
  input: "Water evaporates when heated"
  chain: [age_adapter → curiosity_spark → memorability_booster]
  output: "I wonder where puddles go when the sun comes out..."
```

### Parallel Composition

```yaml
operation: merge
description: Apply multiple sticks, merge outputs
example:
  input: "Teach multiplication tables"
  parallel: [memorability_booster, rhyme_finder]
  merge: Combine rhythm with rhyme patterns
```

### Conditional Composition

```yaml
operation: branch
description: Select sticks based on conditions
example:
  if: technique == "memorization"
    apply: [structure_scaffold(memorization)]
  else:
    apply: [structure_scaffold(connection)]
```

## Harmony Measurement

```yaml
harmony_indicators:
  coherence:
    measure: Output flows naturally
    low_harmony: Jerky transitions, inconsistent tone
    high_harmony: Smooth progression, unified voice

  effectiveness:
    measure: Consumer success rate
    low_harmony: Users report confusion
    high_harmony: Learning objectives achieved

  alignment:
    measure: Sticks work together without conflict
    low_harmony: Vocabulary_gate removes rhyme_finder choices
    high_harmony: All sticks reinforce each other
```

---

## Weaving Process

```yaml
weave:
  name: Complete generation flow
  process: |
    1. LOAD language_router (set cognitive frame)
    2. ALIGN age_adapter (set constraints)
    3. COMPOSE [curiosity_spark + structure_scaffold]
    4. REINFORCE [memorability_booster + rhyme_finder]
    5. VALIDATE [vocabulary_gate]
    6. OUTPUT: Harmonious result

  harmony_check: |
    FOR each pair of applied sticks:
      CHECK alignment (no conflicts)
      CHECK coherence (smooth transitions)
    IF harmony < threshold:
      ADJUST composition order
      RE-WEAVE
```

---

## Evolution Through Use

```yaml
vector_refinement:
  observation: |
    Consumer usage reveals vector misalignment.
    Example: memorability_booster conflicts with vocabulary_gate

  adjustment: |
    Refine stick logic to reduce conflict.
    Add explicit composition rules.
    Update priority ordering.

  measurement: |
    Track harmony metrics over time.
    Higher harmony = better vectors.
    Co-building improves the space.
```
