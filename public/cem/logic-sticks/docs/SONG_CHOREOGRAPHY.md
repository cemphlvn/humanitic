# Song Choreography — Movement for Learning

> **For: Dance Teachers, PE Teachers, Kinesthetic Educators**
> Edit this file to improve movement patterns. No coding needed.

## Purpose

Movement anchors memory. Kids who MOVE while learning retain **40% more**.

But movements must be:
- **Simple** — doable while singing
- **Rhythmic** — on the beat
- **Meaningful** — connect to the content

## Core Movement Vocabulary

| Marker | Movement | When to use |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `[clap]` | Single hand clap | Emphasis, beat marker |
| `[clap clap]` | Double clap | End of phrase |
| `[stomp]` | Foot stomp | Strong emphasis |
| `[snap]` | Finger snap | Lighter emphasis |
| `[wave]` | Hand wave motion | Flow, water, air |
| `[point up]` | Point to sky | Sky, up, high |
| `[point down]` | Point to ground | Earth, down, low |
| `[spin]` | Quarter turn | Change, transformation |
| `[freeze]` | Stop all movement | Surprise, attention |
| `[march]` | March in place | Sequence, counting |

## Age-Appropriate Movements

### Ages 5-7
- Gross motor only: clap, stomp, jump, spin
- No fine motor: no snapping (hard for small hands)
- Max 2 different movements per song
- Movements on EVERY chorus

### Ages 8-10
- Add: snap, wave, point
- Max 4 different movements per song
- Can have movement sequences (clap-clap-stomp)

### Ages 11-14
- Full vocabulary available
- Can create their own movements
- Movement optional but enhances retention

## Placement Rules

1. **Chorus gets most movement** — it's what they need to remember
2. **Movements on strong beats** — not between words
3. **Same movement = same concept** — consistency aids memory
4. **Rest moments matter** — not every line needs movement

## Movement Density

| Song type | Movements per chorus | Movements per verse |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Memorization | 4-6 | 1-2 |
| Connection | 2-4 | 0-1 |

---

## Examples

### Good placement
```
Blue light scatters [clap clap]
Bounces all around [clap clap]
```

### Bad placement (too dense)
```
Blue [clap] light [snap] scatters [stomp] bounces [wave] all [clap] around [stomp]
```

### Meaningful movement
```
Light goes UP [point up] and DOWN [point down]
Scatters ALL around [spin]
```
