> **For: Musicians, Songwriters, Music Teachers**
> Edit this file to improve song structure rules. No coding needed.

## Purpose

Songs are NOT poems. They must be:
- **Singable** in one breath per line
- **Memorable** through repetition
- **Brief** — 2 minutes max for memorization, 3 minutes for connection

---

## Line Length Rules

| Age | Max words per line | Max syllables per line |
|-----|-------------------|------------------------|
| 5-7 | 5 | 8 |
| 8-10 | 7 | 12 |
| 11-14 | 9 | 15 |

**Why:** Children need to sing lines in one breath. Longer = forgotten.

---

## Section Length Rules

### Memorization Songs

| Section | Lines | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Hook | 2-4 | Grab attention, state mystery |
| Verse | 4-6 | Build toward chorus |
| Chorus | 4 | THE FACT (repeat exactly) |
| Bridge | 4 | Playful twist or application |

**Total song:** 20-30 lines max

### Connection Songs

| Section | Lines | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Anchor | 4 | Familiar ground |
| Bridge Verse | 4-6 | Known → unknown |
| Chorus | 4 | Core concept |
| Expansion | 4-6 | Deeper why/how |
| Application | 4 | Real world use |

**Total song:** 25-35 lines max

---

## Repetition Rules

- Chorus: **Repeat EXACTLY** (same words every time)
- Key fact: Appears **4+ times** in memorization songs
- Core concept: Appears **3+ times** in connection songs
- Hook phrase: Returns in final line

## What Makes Lines Singable

### Good (singable)
```
Blue light bounces all around
Small waves scatter, hit the ground
```

### Bad (prose, not singable)
```
When sunlight enters the atmosphere it encounters tiny particles
The blue wavelengths scatter more because they are smaller
```
